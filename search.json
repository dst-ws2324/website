    "text": "Data storytelling is a pivotal skill in the modern data-driven world, acting as a bridge between raw data and meaningful insights. It entails the use of visual elements and narrative techniques to convey complex data insights in an engaging and understandable manner.\nBy transforming dry figures into compelling stories, data storytelling not only simplifies the understanding of complex analyses but also captivates the audience‚Äôs attention, making the data memorable and impactful. It fosters a deeper connection between the data and the audience, enabling better decision-making and promoting a culture of informed, data-driven discourse within organizations and the broader community.\nThrough data storytelling, we harness the power of both analytical and creative thinking to derive and communicate meaningful insights from the data, fostering a richer comprehension and appreciation of the stories that data unfolds.\nThis course teaches you the fundamentals of data visualization and how to communicate effectively with data using Python. With visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data."

Students affirm their commitment to uphold the values by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of the course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow HdM policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one‚Äôs own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects.\n\n\n9.2 Collaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what‚Äôs the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the project, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected (use GitHub Projects). Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\n9.3 Policy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.\nUnless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course‚Äôs policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g.¬†StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nAny recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nOn individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\n9.4 Late work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material. However, I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Here are the rules for late submissions:\n\nHomeworks may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nProject may be submitted up to 2 days late. There will be a 25% deduction for each 24-hour period the project task is late.\n\nIf there are important circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email me at kirenz@hdm-stuttgart.de before the deadline."
